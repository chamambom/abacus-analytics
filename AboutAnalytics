Having pools of big data to dive into doesn't change the basic tenets of analytical modeling for predictive analytics and data mining,
Patterns and relationships hidden in sets of big data typically can be found by looking at representative samples of the available information,
without having to comb through it all.

"I don't tend to end up using very much data [in analytical models]," Berry said. "Patterns reveal themselves pretty quickly.
And when you have enough data to spot a pattern, the results don't change if you add more data." Often, he added, he gets better
answers on analytical queries " if I look at less data in a shorter time than I do if I spend more time and look at more data."


"Sampling is a powerful thing," agreed Karl Rexer, president of consulting services company Rexer Analytics in Winchester, Mass.
In developing an analytical model to predict potential customer churn, an analytics team at a large company might have access to millions
 of records on hundreds of thousands of customers."But," Rexer said, "do you need to use all that data? A lot of times, the answer is no."

starts with only about 5,000 data records when he builds predictive models for clients, even if much more information is there for the taking.

Throwing more data at analytical models without proper attention to sampling might make them less accurate by adding "noise" to the equation.

Builds its predictive models around sample data sets, not the entire data vault.
